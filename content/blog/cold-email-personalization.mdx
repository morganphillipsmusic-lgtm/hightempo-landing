"I noticed you're the VP of Sales at [Company]..."

Delete.

"Congrats on the recent Series B!"

Delete.

"I saw your post on LinkedIn about [generic topic]..."

You guessed it. Delete.

Generic personalization is worse than no personalization. It signals that you're mass-emailing while pretending you're not.

Here's what actually works.

## The Problem with "Personalization"

Most personalization is surface-level:
- Name and company (everyone does this)
- Title acknowledgment (so what?)
- Generic congratulations (you and 50 other vendors)
- LinkedIn post reference (often feels stalker-y)

This isn't personalization. It's mail merge with extra steps.

Real personalization demonstrates you understand their **specific situation and timing.**

## Signal-Based Personalization

Instead of personalizing based on static information (title, company, industry), personalize based on **signals** that indicate why they need your product *right now*.

### The Formula

**[Specific signal] + [Why it matters to them] + [How you help] = Reply**

Let's break this down with examples.

## Example 1: Funding Signal

**Bad:**
> Hi Sarah, Congrats on the Series B! I'd love to show you how Acme can help with your growth.

**Why it fails:** Every vendor sends this. It's generic and self-serving.

**Good:**
> Hi Sarah,
>
> Saw you closed the $30M Series B last month—congrats. Based on the announcement, it looks like you're expanding the sales team significantly.
>
> Most post-Series B companies we work with face the same challenge: ramping new reps fast enough to hit the aggressive targets that come with fresh funding.
>
> We helped [Similar Company] cut ramp time from 6 months to 3 after their Series B. Happy to share how.
>
> Worth a conversation?

**Why it works:**
- Specific signal (Series B + sales expansion)
- Their challenge (ramp time vs. growth targets)
- Social proof (similar company, specific result)
- Clear ask

## Example 2: New Executive Signal

**Bad:**
> Hi James, Congrats on the new role! As the new VP of Sales, you're probably looking at your tech stack...

**Why it fails:** Obvious, generic, assumes too much.

**Good:**
> Hi James,
>
> Noticed you joined Acme from Gong three weeks ago. The transition from a $2B company to a Series A startup is intense—I've seen a lot of new sales leaders struggle with inheriting systems that worked at a different scale.
>
> One thing that tends to surface quickly: the pipeline your predecessor left you was probably built on a different ICP. New leadership usually means new strategy.
>
> If you're re-evaluating who to target, I'd be happy to share the signal-based approach we use with companies in similar transitions.
>
> Open to a quick call?

**Why it works:**
- Specific signal (new VP, previous company known)
- Acknowledges the real challenge (inherited systems, new strategy)
- Positions as peer, not vendor
- Offers value, not a demo

## Example 3: Hiring Signal

**Bad:**
> Hi Lisa, I saw you're hiring SDRs. We help with sales training...

**Why it fails:** Correlation isn't causation. Hiring SDRs doesn't mean they need training.

**Good:**
> Hi Lisa,
>
> I noticed Acme posted 5 SDR roles in the last two weeks, plus a Sales Enablement Manager role yesterday.
>
> That combination usually means one of two things: either you're scaling a motion that's working, or you're rebuilding after some turnover. Either way, getting 5+ new reps productive fast is going to be critical.
>
> Most enablement leaders I talk to say their biggest challenge isn't training content—it's knowing which accounts new reps should actually prioritize.
>
> We help teams identify which accounts have active buying signals so new reps spend time on real opportunities, not static lists.
>
> Worth exploring?

**Why it works:**
- Multiple signals combined (SDR hiring + enablement hire)
- Acknowledges possible scenarios without assuming
- Addresses real challenge (new rep productivity)
- Clear, specific offer

## Example 4: Tech Stack Signal

**Bad:**
> Hi Mike, I saw you use Salesforce. We integrate with Salesforce...

**Why it fails:** So does everyone. This is a feature, not a reason to talk.

**Good:**
> Hi Mike,
>
> Noticed your team added Outreach last quarter but removed SalesLoft. That switch usually happens when teams are getting serious about scaling outbound.
>
> One thing that often gets overlooked in that transition: the sequences work great, but they're only as good as the lists you're feeding them.
>
> We've been helping teams pair Outreach automation with buying-signal data so reps sequence accounts that are actually in-market, not just ICP-fit.
>
> The teams we work with see 3-4x higher reply rates than generic ICP lists.
>
> Open to a quick call to see if this could help your team?

**Why it works:**
- Specific tech change signal (tool switch)
- Infers intent from the change
- Addresses a gap in their current approach
- Quantified result

## The Signal Hierarchy

Not all signals are equal. Here's how to prioritize:

### Tier 1: Active Buying Signals (use immediately)
- RFP issued in your category
- Removing a competitor's product
- Job post mentioning your tool category
- Direct inquiry or demo request

### Tier 2: Change Signals (use within 2 weeks)
- New executive in target department
- Funding announcement
- Merger or acquisition
- Significant hiring spike

### Tier 3: Growth Signals (use within 30 days)
- Revenue/growth announcements
- New office or market expansion
- Product launches
- Partnership announcements

### Tier 4: Contextual Signals (use as supplementary)
- Industry events or trends
- Competitive moves
- Regulatory changes
- Earnings call mentions

## Making It Scalable

"This sounds like a lot of work for each email."

It is. That's why it works.

But you can scale it:

1. **Build signal templates** - Create email frameworks for each signal type
2. **Automate signal detection** - Use tools that surface signals automatically
3. **Batch by signal** - Write to all "new VP" signals at once
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Only personalize for high-value accounts

The math works out: 20 highly-personalized emails to signal-verified accounts outperform 200 generic emails to a static list.

## Start Today

Pick one signal type. Write one great email template. Send to 10 accounts.

Measure the results against your current approach.

You'll never go back to generic personalization.
